Contributions that follow the [etiquette guidlines]() (forthcoming) will be accepted via Pull Request. The recommended process for submitting a contribution is:

1. Soft task: Determine if this project is the best location for your proposal. Is there [another project](https://github.com/chicagomathloop) where your contibutions could be better appreciated? Should you propose a new project?
2. Fork [chicagomathloop.github.io](https://github.com/chicagomathloop/chicagomathloop.github.io), if you have not already.
3. Create a branch based on `develop` by running `git checkout -b <yourbranchname>`
4. Make your changes and commit to `<yourbranchname>`
5. Issue a Pull Request targeting `develop` branch on the main `chicagomathloop.github.io` project
6. If everything looks O.K. and there are no objections from the community, [an organizer](https://github.com/orgs/ChicagoMathLoop/teams/owners) will merge and publish the changes.
